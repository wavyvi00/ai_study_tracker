## 🚀 Quick Start

### macOS

**Development Mode:**
```bash
./setup.sh
source venv/bin/activate
python3 desktop_app.py
```

**Build Standalone App:**
```bash
./build.sh
# Creates: dist/FocusWin.app
```

### Windows

**Development Mode:**
```batch
setup-windows.bat
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python desktop_app.py
```

**Build Standalone App:**
```batch
build-windows.bat
REM Creates: dist\FocusWin\FocusWin.exe
REM Note: Requires MediaPipe (might need manual install on some Windows setups)
```

## 🎯 How It Works

The tracker monitors your active window and classifies your activity as either **studying** or **distracted**:

### Study Apps (Earn XP + Health)
- Code editors: VS Code, Cursor, Xcode, IntelliJ, PyCharm
- Learning platforms: Canvas, Notion, Obsidian
- Documentation: PDF viewers, docs
- Development tools: Terminal

### Distraction Apps (Lose Health)
- Social media: YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram
- Entertainment: Netflix, games
- Other non-productive apps

### Camera Intelligence (New!) 🧠
- **Attention Score**: 0-100 score based on face orientation and gaze
- **XP Multiplier**: Earn up to **1.0x XP** when focused, drops to **0.5x** when distracted
- **Auto-Pause**: Session pauses automatically when you leave your desk
- **Phone Penalty**: **-50 points** to attention score if phone usage is detected
- **Posture Warnings**: Get notified if you slouch for too long

### Rewards System
- **+1 XP per second** of studying (multiplied by attention score)
- **Level up** every 100 XP
- **Health regenerates** slowly while studying (+0.1/sec)
- **Health decreases** when distracted (-0.5/sec)

## ⚡ Quick Start (No Python Required)

### For Users - Download & Run

1. **Download the standalone app** (when available)
   - Get `AI Study Tracker.app` from releases

2. **First launch**
   - Double-click `AI Study Tracker.app`
   - If macOS blocks it: Right-click → Open
   - Or: System Settings → Privacy & Security → "Open Anyway"

3. **Grant permissions**
   - System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording
   - Enable Terminal or Python
   - Restart the app

4. **Enable Camera (Optional)**
   - Click the camera icon in the UI to enable AI tracking
   - Grant Camera permissions if prompted

That's it! No Python installation needed.

## 🛠️ For Developers

### Building the Standalone App

Want to build the app yourself? Use the automated build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will create `dist/AI Study Tracker.app` - a standalone application bundle.

### Development Setup

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies (including MediaPipe, OpenCV)
- Set up the development environment

Then run:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 desktop_app.py
```

### 🎥 Dev Mode (Live Feed)

Want to see what the AI sees?

1. Start the application
2. Open your browser to: `http://127.0.0.1:5002/dev_mode`
3. You will see:
   - Live video feed
   - Face Mesh overlays
   - Head Pose angles (Pitch/Yaw/Roll)
   - Real-time attention score
   - Phone detection status

setup-windows.bat
```

**Option B: Manual Setup**

1. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   
   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   **Windows:**
   ```batch
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   
   **macOS:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-macos.txt
   ```
   
   **Windows:**
   ```batch
   pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
   ```

3. **Grant permissions (macOS only)**
   - Open **System Settings**
   - Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Screen Recording**
   - Enable **Terminal** or **Python**
   - Restart the app after granting permissions

### Running the App

```bash
source venv/bin/activate

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing Study/Distraction Keywords

Edit `tracker.py` to modify what counts as studying:

```python
self.study_keywords = ['code', 'terminal', 'docs', 'pdf', 'canvas', 'notion', ...]
self.distraction_keywords = ['youtube', 'twitter', 'reddit', 'facebook', ...]
```

### Camera Settings

Edit `camera_config.json` (created after first run) to adjust:
- `auto_pause_enabled`: Pause session when away
- `posture_warnings_enabled`: Enable/disable posture alerts
- `break_interval_minutes`: Time between break reminders

### Adjusting Rewards

Edit `gamification.py` to change XP and health rates:

```python
self.xp += 1  # XP per second of studying
self.health = min(100, self.health + 0.1)  # Health regen rate
self.decrease_health(0.5)  # Health loss rate when distracted
```

### Level Up Formula

Currently: **100 XP per level**

```python
if self.xp >= self.level * 100:
    self.level += 1
```

## 🎨 UI Components

The interface features:
- **Timer Display**: Shows total study time in HH:MM:SS format
- **Status Badge**: Real-time studying/distracted indicator
- **Health Bar**: Visual health indicator with color coding
  - Green (>50%)
  - Orange (20-50%)
  - Red (<20%)
- **Level Circle**: Displays current level with gradient background
- **XP Counter**: Shows accumulated experience points
- **Active Window Display**: Shows currently tracked app and window

## 🔐 Privacy & Data

All tracking data is stored locally in `study_data.json`:

```json
{
  "xp": 4170,
  "level": 42,
  "health": 100,
  "total_study_seconds": 4470
}
```

This file is automatically excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "loginwindow" appears constantly
- **Cause**: Missing Screen Recording permissions
- **Fix**: Grant permissions in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording

### App doesn't track window titles
- **Cause**: Quartz requires Screen Recording permission
- **Fix**: Enable Terminal/Python in Screen Recording settings and restart

### Health keeps decreasing
- **Cause**: Current app not in study keywords list
- **Fix**: Add your app to `study_keywords` in `tracker.py`

### Data not persisting
- **Cause**: Permission issues with `study_data.json`
- **Fix**: Check file permissions and ensure write access

### macOS blocks the standalone app (Gatekeeper)
- **Cause**: App is not code-signed
- **Fix**: Right-click the app → Open (instead of double-clicking)
- **Alternative**: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Click "Open Anyway"
- **Note**: This only needs to be done once per app

## 🛠️ Development

### Running in Debug Mode

For web-only testing without the native window:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5002` in your browser.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main application UI
- `GET /api/status` - Returns current tracking state (JSON)
- `GET /api/camera/status` - Returns camera tracking state (JSON)
- `GET /video_feed` - MJPEG stream of camera feed (Dev Mode)

### Response Format

```json
{
  "app_name": "Cursor",
  "window_title": "tracker.py",
  "is_studying": true,
  "xp": 4170,
  "level": 42,
