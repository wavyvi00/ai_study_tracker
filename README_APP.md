# AI Study Tracker - Quick Start Guide

## First Time Setup (One-Time Only)

1. **Double-click** `AI Study Tracker.app` on your Desktop
2. macOS will ask for **Camera** and **Microphone** permissions
3. Click **"Allow"** for both
4. The app window will appear!

## Using the App

- **Magic Ball**: Click the glowing orb to speak voice commands
  - "Start session"
  - "Stop session"  
  - "How am I doing?"
  - "Hello"

- **Camera Detection**: Automatically tracks your focus and detects distractions

## Troubleshooting

### If the app doesn't open:
1. Right-click the app → Open (instead of double-clicking)
2. Click "Open" in the security dialog

### If microphone doesn't work:
1. Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Microphone**
2. Find "AI Study Tracker" and turn it ON
3. Restart the app

### If you see "Python not found":
The app requires Python 3 to be installed. Run this in Terminal:
```bash
brew install python3
```

## Moving the App

You can move `AI Study Tracker.app` anywhere you want:
- Applications folder
- Desktop
- Dock (drag and drop)

Just don't move or delete the `/Users/victorrodriguez/Desktop/ai_study_tracker` folder - the app needs those files!
